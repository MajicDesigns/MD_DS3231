The Maxim DS3231 Real Time Clock IC
-----------------------------------
The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C real time clock (RTC) with an 
integrated temperature compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal.

Microprocessor interface is exclusively through an I2C bidirectional bus.

The device 
- incorporates a battery input, and maintains accurate timekeeping when main power 
to the device is interrupted. 
- maintains seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information. 
- automatically adjusts dates for months with fewer than 31 days, including 
corrections for leap year. 
- operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator.
- includes two programmable time-of day alarms.
- has and frequency programmable square-wave output.

Precision is maintained through a temperature-compensated voltage reference
and comparator circuit monitors the status of Vcc to detect power failures 
and to automatically switch to the backup supply when necessary.

This library features access to all on-chip features
- Read and write clock time registers
- Read and write alarm registers and controls
- Read/write clock and alarm registers as RAM
- Control of square wave generator (on/off & frequency)
- Control of clock features (Square Wave type and on/off, 12/24H, day of week, etc)

Using the Library
-----------------

The library has a simple interface to the RTC hardware implemented through:
- a set of time (h, m, s and dow) and date (yyyy, mm, dd) variables. All data to and from
the RTC passes through these. Clock or alarm time data is read or written to these interface
registers before the appropriate methods are invoke to act on that data.
- control() and status() methods to set and query the functionality of the RTC.
- specific functions to set and test for each of the two alarms.

Alarms may be operated in either polled mode or interrupt mode, as described below.

___

The Control and Status Methods
----------------------------------
The control() and status() methods are the main interface to action setting parameters or 
status values. The parameters used for each are similar, but not symmetrical, due
to the way the hardware is implemented. The table below highlights the combinations of valid 
parameters for the control() method and whether a parameter can be changed by user code.

The status() method will return the current value from the parameter nominated and is guaranteed to
be in the valid set.

DS3231_CLOCK_HALT    |Y|Y| DS3231_ON, DS3231_OFF

Working with the Current Time
-----------------------------
__Reading__ the current time from the clock is a call to the readTime() method. The current date 
and time is then available in the interface registers.

__Writing__ the current time is a sequence of writing to the interface registers followed by a call 
to the writeTime() method.

___

Working with Alarms
-------------------
__Writing__ the alarm trigger time data is achieve by writing to the interface registers followed
by a call to the setAlarm1() or setAlarm2() method. The alarm type is specified when the method is invoked, 
and is one of the almType_t values, noting that values are specific to alarm 1 and alarm 2.

__Reading__ the alarm trigger set is by invoking the getAlarm1() or getAlarm2() methods to load the interface 
registers, from which the data can be read. The alarm trigger type is obtained separately using the 
getAlarm1Type() or getAlarm2Type() methods.

__Checking__ if an alarm has triggered can be done in two ways, depending on whether it is a polled alarm or 
interrupts have been enabled.

- _Polled Alarms_ are implemented by calling the checkAlarm1() or checkAlarm2() method. If a callback function
is defined (using setAlarm1Callback() or setAlarm2Callback()) the callback function will be invoked. These methods 
encapsulate a check for the alarm trigger, invoke the callback function if triggered and reset the alarm flag, 
effectively providing an interrupt-like operation without the restrictions of being in an interrupt routine. If 
no callback function is defined, the return status from the checkAlarm1() or checkAlarm2() should be used instead.

- _Interrupt Alarms_ are configured by invoking the control() method to enable interrupts (INT_ENABLE), followed 
by enabling the interrupt for the required alarm (A1_INT_ENABLE or A2_INT_ENABLE). The alarm flag (control() with 
A1FLAG or A2_FLAG) should be rest to initialize a 'zero' start for the interrupt cycles. Once the interrupt cycle has 
completed, the alarm flag must be reset to re-enable the interrupt (control() with parameter A1_FLAG or A2_FLAG).
The interrupt handler must be set up externally from the library and the hardware properly configured to accept the 
interrupt. Note, however:
 + the interrupt line from the DS3231 will be held logic HIGH and the interrupt is at logic LOW, so
a HIGH to LOW transition (FALLING) should be specified as the interrupt trigger.
 + during the interrupt there can be no I2C communications as this uses interrupts. So checking a RTC
 status in the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is not possible.

The DS3231_LCD_Time example has examples of the different ways of interacting with the RTC.
